This new question tests the same logic as the original question by focusing on the designing with test cases.
The core concepts being tested are still the same -  I had to create test cases for a given set of requirements without writing the actual logic for the functions.
This tests my ability to understand and create test cases based on given requirements, focusing on the importance of test-driven development.
I created test cases for the water sprinkler and circular area classes, ensuring the correct behavior of the sprinkler's range and angle attributes,
and the circular area's radius and center point attributes.




Advanced04:
 // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Advanced_05_myClass. Name them something
  // useful, other than "myClass", that is just an example.

  // TODO 1: Imagine that you are asked to create a WaterSprinkler class
  // that sprays water in a CircularArea class. The WaterSprinkler class has
  // a range and angle attributes. The CircularArea class has radius
  // and center point attributes. Create the test cases for this class.
  // The high-level things that you want it to accomplish are the following:
  // - The water sprinkler sprays water in a circular pattern within the specified range
  // - The angle of the water sprinkler determines the sector of the CircularArea being covered
  // - The CircularArea class should calculate the area covered by the sprinkler
  // - The WaterSprinkler class should be able to adjust its range and angle during runtime

  // Note that you may need more than one test case per requirement.
  // Also note that you do NOT need to write the logic for these functions,
  // just create the test coverage.
