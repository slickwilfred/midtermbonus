/*
This new version tests my ability to implement the Comparable interface and its compare to/equals methods. I use these to compare objects based on their
attribute values and define a comparison criteria in the compare to method. This question also requires me to test the implementation of these methods by
using exceptions and edge cases.



Advanced06CoordinatePoint:
You have been given a CoordinatePoint class that has two integer attributes latitude and longitude.
Your task is to implement the equals and Comparable interfaces for this class.

Follow the specifications below to implement the interfaces:

Implement an equals method that checks the latitude and longitude attributes of the incoming object against the attributes of the current object.
The method should only return true if the incoming object is of the same class and has the same latitude and longitude attributes.

Make the CoordinatePoint class implement the Comparable interface. Implement all the methods that the interface demands.
Compare objects based on their distance from the equator (i.e., their absolute latitude value).
Ensure that the equals method has the same comparison criteria as the compareTo method.

Write a main method in the CoordinatePoint class that demonstrates the implementation of the equals and Comparable interfaces,
including testing the edge cases and exceptions.

Your test cases should ensure that the equals and Comparable interfaces work correctly,
including testing for the proper comparison of objects based on their distance from the equator.
You should also test edge cases to ensure that your implementation is robust and can handle unexpected inputs.
