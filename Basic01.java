/*
This question tests the same concepts as the original question by requiring the creation of a class with state that can be modified through methods.
The Basic01Location class keeps track of a label, latitude, and longitude attribute, which can be modified through the move method.
This method updates the location's latitude and longitude values and increments the moveCount.
The main method creates a new Basic01Location object, moves it twice, and verifies that the location's attributes have been updated correctly.
This question requires the implementation of a class, methods, and state manipulation, which are also required in the original question.



//Basic01:
// Idea: tests your ability to create classes that persist state.

// README FIRST
// I will ONLY be reading from this package:
//   org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers
//
// TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
// Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
// question label, e.g., Basic_01_myClass. Name them something useful,
// other than "myClass", that is just an example.

// TODO 1: Create a new Basic_01_Location class that persists the
// following state as class attributes:
// (1) An integer ID generated on construction.
// (2) A string name passed during construction.
// (3) A float X and a float Y position.
// (4) An integer count of how many times it's been moved.
