/*
This question test my understanding of the comparable interface as well as
the use of the equals and compare to methods. These methods checks if two objects are equal based on
their attributes.


Intermediate06:
The Intermediate06Comparable class has a single attribute x and a constructor that sets the value of x. Your task is to implement the equals and Comparable interfaces for this class.

Follow the specifications below to implement the interfaces:

Implement an equals method that checks the x attribute of the incoming object against the x attribute of the current object. The method should only return true if the incoming object is of the same class and has the same x attribute.
Make the Intermediate_06_Comparable class implement the Comparable interface. Implement all the methods that the interface demands. Compare objects based on their x attribute. Ensure that the equals method has the same comparison criteria as the compareTo method.
Write a main method in the Intermediate_06_Comparable class that demonstrates the implementation of the equals and Comparable interfaces, including testing the edge cases and exceptions.
Your test cases should ensure that the equals and Comparable interfaces work correctly, including testing for the proper comparison of objects based on their x attribute. You should also test edge cases to ensure that your implementation is robust and can handle unexpected inputs.
